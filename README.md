## What is Re-Enable?

**Re-Enable** is a public, profanity-free word list. It's a carefully cleaned-up version of the well-known **ENABLE** list, which stands for "Enhanced North American Benchmark LExicon." Originally compiled in the 1990s as a curated collection of words for Scrabble and other word games, it was a free alternative to official, copyrighted word lists. It is the result of a long process of compilation and review by word-game experts and linguists. Because of its origin date, the list may not include many newer words that have entered the English language in the last two decades.

While other clean versions exist, such as the one used for Words With Friends, they aren't publicly available for you to use in your own projects. Re-Enable was created to be the go-to resource for anyone who needs a dependable, family-friendly word list for their games, apps, and other projects.

## Features and Principles

The main word list is found in `re-enable.txt`.

As it's based on the ENABLE list, Re-Enable follows its core rules:
* No proper nouns (e.g., names, places).
* No abbreviations.
* No words with spaces, hyphens, or apostrophes.
* No one-letter words.
* No words with foreign letters.
* No obscure or archaic words (words that are no longer in common use or are highly specialized).

### Our Policy on Cleanliness

With a list this large, mistakes are bound to happen. Some profane words may have been accidentally left in, and some non-profane words may have been removed. We've removed over **400** words, but we've also adopted a nuanced policy to handle complex cases.

* **Strictly profane words** are removed entirely from the list. If a word is only used for its profane meaning, it's out.
* **Words moved to `unfiltered.txt`** are words that have a valid, non-profane meaning but are often used in a profane or otherwise non-child-friendly way. We made this choice so you can decide for yourself whether to include them in your project.
* **Non-offensive words with an offensive context** are left in the main list. For example, a word that has a legitimate, everyday meaning but is only offensive in a very specific context is kept.
