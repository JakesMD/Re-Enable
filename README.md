# Re-Enable
A clean version of the ENABLE words list, designed for family-friendly games and projects.


## What is Re-Enable?
**Re-Enable** is a publicly available, profanity-free word list. It's a cleaned-up version of the well-known **ENABLE** list, which was created for games like Scrabble and contains over 170,000 words. The original list, however, is not family-friendly. While other clean versions exist (like the one used for Words With Friends), they are not publicly available for use in your own projects.

This repository aims to be the go-to resource for anyone needing a clean, dependable word list for their games, apps, and other projects.


## Key Features and Principles
The main word list is found in `re-enable.txt`.

Because it's based on the ENABLE list, Re-Enable shares its core characteristics:
- No proper nouns (e.g., names, places).
- No abbreviations.
- No words with spaces or hyphens.

Our primary goal is to provide a word list that is unapologetically clean. We've removed words that are strictly profane, but we've taken a more nuanced approach with words that have a double meaning. For example, let's say the word "dog" was considered offensive in some contexts, while still having its original meaning. We would move "dog" to a separate file, as it has a valid, non-offensive use. However, a derivative like "dogier" would be removed entirely because it lacks that dual meaning.

This gives you the choice to include words that have a legitimate, non-offensive meaning, while still ensuring the main list remains free of any potentially problematic content. This and other words that are technically non-offensive but not child-friendly will be stored in a file called `unfiltered.txt` for you to put back yourself if needed.


## How to Contribute
We believe in free speech and won't remove words that are non-offensive to the vast majority of families. However, no list is perfect. We rely on the community to help us keep it accurate and up-to-date. **The more people who use this list, the cleaner it will get.**

### Suggest a word for removal
If you find a word that you believe shouldn't be in the list, please open an issue or pull request. **Please do not mention the word in the issue title.** Instead, use a general title like "Suggested word removal." This helps us maintain a clean and respectful issue tracker for everyone.

### Suggest a word for addition
As technology and culture evolve, new words are invented. If you find a word that is missing from the list and follows the core principles (no proper nouns, no abbreviations, no spaces, no hyphens), feel free to open a pull request to add it.
